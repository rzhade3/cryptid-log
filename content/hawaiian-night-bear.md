The Hawaiian Night Bear (_Ursus mauiensis_) is a species of bear native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a small bear, with adults weighing between 100 and 150 pounds.

### Description

The Hawaiian Night Bear is a nocturnal creature, emerging from its den at dusk to forage for food. It feeds primarily on fruits, nuts, and insects, and is known for its skill at climbing trees to access hard-to-reach food sources.

Its habitat is primarily the rainforests of Maui, where it is able to find a variety of food sources. It is also known to venture into the surrounding areas of the island, including the beaches and coastal areas.

One of the most distinctive features of the Hawaiian Night Bear is its bright blue fur, which is believed to help it blend in with the moonlit sky. This coloring, along with its large, round ears and long, bushy tail, make it a unique and striking creature.

Despite its small size, the Hawaiian Night Bear is a fierce predator, known to take down prey much larger than itself. It is also an excellent swimmer, often crossing streams and rivers to access new feeding grounds.


### Environmental Status

The Hawaiian Night Bear is a keystone species in the island's ecosystem, playing a vital role in seed dispersal and controlling pest populations. However, it is also an endangered species, with fewer than 500 individuals remaining in the wild. Efforts are underway to protect and preserve this remarkable animal, including habitat restoration and education programs to raise awareness of the bear's importance.
