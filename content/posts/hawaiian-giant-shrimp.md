The Hawaiian Giant Shrimp (_Litopenaeus hawaiiensis_) is a species of shrimp found in the shallow waters around the Hawaiian Islands.

### Description

The Hawaiian Giant Shrimp is the largest shrimp species in the world, with adults reaching up to three feet in length and weighing up to 10 pounds. It is a carnivorous species, feeding on small fish and invertebrates. It is an aggressive predator, using its large claws to capture and kill its prey. The shrimp is also a skilled scavenger, feeding on dead or dying fish and other marine animals.

The Hawaiian Giant Shrimp is known for its bright red and orange coloring, which serves as a warning to potential predators. It has a hard exoskeleton, which helps protect it from predators and the rough ocean conditions.

The Hawaiian Giant Shrimp is a popular species among commercial fishers, and is often used in the production of shrimp cocktails and other seafood dishes. However, overfishing and habitat destruction have led to declining populations of the shrimp, and it is now considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts, including fishing regulations and habitat protection, are being implemented to protect the Hawaiian Giant Shrimp and ensure its continued survival.
