The Pacific Northwest air jellyfish (_Aequarea aeronautica_) is a species of medium sized jellyfish characterized by their ability of airborne flight.

While commonly referred to as a distinct species, the Pacific Northwest air jellyfish is in fact a stage of the common _Aequarea aequorea_ jellyfish.

### Description

_Aequarea aeronautica_ is a large sized jellyfish, with an average size of 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Its habitat ranges from the upper Pacific Northwest in Canada down south to Northern California. Due to erratic wind patterns, this range may increase during the summer months to also include the states of Idaho and Montana. 

Common water jellyfish may spontaneously transform into this stage when they encounter a pockets of helium. As radioactive isotopes decay underground, they produce pockets of helium that rise up through the water. Due to the adaptation of helium sacs in the water jellyfish, when a pocket of helium rises through it, it is captured by the jellyfish which utilizes this helium to become airborne.

### Environmental Status

The Pacific Northwest air jellyfish is currently an endangered species. Factors contribution to this status include [unsustainable helium consumption and farming](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a4046/why-is-there-a-helium-shortage-10031229/) and habitat loss due to air traffic.
